### Explanation

- **CulturalContext Class**: This class is responsible for providing culturally relevant responses based on the user's profile and cultural data.
  
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_profile`: An instance of `UserProfile` that contains user preferences such as language and context preference.
  - `cultural_data`: A dictionary containing cultural context data, which is used to tailor responses.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__`: Initializes the class with a user profile and cultural data.
  - `provide_contextual_response`: Takes user input text and provides a response based on the cultural context. It retrieves the appropriate cultural context using the user's language and context preference, then generates a response.

This implementation assumes that `cultural_data` is a nested dictionary where the first level keys are languages, and the second level keys are context preferences, each mapping to a specific cultural context.
